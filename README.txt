This is(hopefully) a password creator, as well as a way to transfer saved passwords between devices

As someone who uses one password for everything, I know the rist that comes along with it(it got leaked one time and I had to scramble to change all my accounts)
After that, I wanted to start using different passwords but I know just how bad my memory is
Other optoins included using the browsers built-in password storage, but that did not transfer between my devices unless I used google chrome across everything, and even then I don't know if I trusted the browsers with all my passwords
Another option was a service such as OnePassword, which this repository is jokingly named after, but those costed money

So I thought why do either of those when I could make my own and so my journey started
